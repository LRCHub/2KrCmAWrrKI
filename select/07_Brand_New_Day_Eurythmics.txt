Six o'clock in the morning
And I'm stepping through the streets
The pavement's cold and empty
Got the blues beneath my feet
Big old sun is rising up
So elegant and thin
Another day is over
For a new day will begin

And the word said, "Hey...
It's a brand new day"
And the word said, "Hey...
It's a brand new day"

Oh baby, baby, baby
I dreamed about you
Please tell me, tell me, tell me
What I've seen could not be true
You have taken my existence
You have filled it full of stones
You have turned into a stranger
Now I need to walk alone

But I won't be sad
I won't be destroyed (no, I won't be)
No, I won't be sad
I won't be destroyed

And the word said, "Hey...
It's a brand new (day)"
And the word said, "Hey..."
Listen to the word, listen to the word
Listen to the word
"It's a brand new (day)"
You've just got to say
You've just got to say...

And the word said, "Hey..."
(Come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
New day, brand new
Summer made you feel like seein' it through
And the word said, "Hey..."
New day, brand new
Summer made you feel like seein' it through

It's a brand new day, yeah
And the world said, "Hey" (hey, hey)
"It's a brand new day" (hey, hey)
And the world said, "Hey" (hey, hey)
"It's a brand new day" (hey, hey)

And the world said, "Hey" (hey, hey)
"It's a brand new day" (hey, hey)
And the world said, "Hey" (hey, hey)
"It's a brand new day" (hey, hey)

And the world said, "Hey" (hey, hey)
"It's a brand new day" (hey, hey)
And the world said, "Hey" (hey, hey)
"It's a brand new day" (hey, hey)
